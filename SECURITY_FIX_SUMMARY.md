# Email Exposure Security Fix - Implementation Summary

## 🔒 Security Issue Resolved
**Issue**: User email addresses were exposed through the `profiles` table to other users who shared project teams or organizations, creating a risk for email harvesting and potential spam/phishing attacks.

**Severity**: ERROR (High)

## ✅ Implemented Solution

### 1. Database Security Hardening
- **Replaced overly permissive RLS policy** with a restrictive one that only allows users to see their own complete profiles
- **Created secure functions** with `SECURITY DEFINER` privileges to safely retrieve team member information without exposing emails
- **Implemented proper authorization checks** within the functions to ensure users can only access appropriate data

### 2. New Secure Functions Created
- `get_safe_team_member_info(target_user_id)` - Returns safe profile data (name, avatar, dates) for individual team members
- `get_project_team_members(project_id)` - Returns safe data for all project team members
- `get_organization_members_safe(org_id)` - Returns safe data for organization members

### 3. Application Code Updates
- **Updated `useSecureProfiles.ts`** to use secure RPC functions instead of direct table queries
- **Created `useSecureTeamMembers.ts`** with hooks for safely fetching team and organization members
- **Maintained existing functionality** while eliminating email exposure risk

## 🛡️ Security Benefits
- **Email addresses are now protected** - only users can see their own email
- **Zero breaking changes** - all existing functionality preserved
- **Proper authorization** - functions verify team/organization membership before returning data
- **Defense in depth** - both RLS policies and function-level security

## 📋 Data Exposed vs Protected

### ✅ Still Available (Safe Data)
- Display name
- Avatar URL  
- Creation date
- User ID
- Role in team/organization

### 🔒 Now Protected (Sensitive Data)
- Email addresses (only visible to the profile owner)

## 🚨 Important Notes
- The remaining security warnings are related to anonymous access policies on other tables, which is a separate lower-priority issue
- **This specific email exposure vulnerability has been completely resolved**
- Application functionality remains unchanged - users can still see team member information, just without email addresses

## 🔧 For Developers
If you need to display team members in your application, use the new secure hooks:
```typescript
import { useProjectTeamMembers, useOrganizationMembers } from "@/hooks/useSecureTeamMembers";
import { useSafeTeamMemberInfo } from "@/hooks/useSecureProfiles";
```

These hooks automatically use the secure backend functions and will never expose email addresses to unauthorized users.
