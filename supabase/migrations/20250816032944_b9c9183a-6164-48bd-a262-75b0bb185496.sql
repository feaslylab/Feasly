-- Important security note: This policy allows team/org members to see profile data

-- Example safe query for team member data (without email):
-- SELECT user_id, full_name, avatar_url, created_at, updated_at FROM profiles WHERE user_id = ?

-- Example query for own profile (with email):
-- SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid()

-- Add comprehensive security documentation
